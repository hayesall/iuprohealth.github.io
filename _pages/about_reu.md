<h2>What is the Proactive Health Informatics REU site?</h2>

<p>The Proactive Health Informatics group’s research aims to build usable, secure, and intelligent pervasive systems that empower people to manage their health and see how their everyday decisions impact their progress to achieve future health goals. Our REU site will provide students with a unique opportunity to learn techniques in the areas of human computer interaction, pervasive computing (mobile or wearable), machine learning, privacy, and the social and legal implications of these technologies. Students will learn appropriate methods, software tools, and analysis techniques related to their project, thus experience is not necessarily required. In addition, all students will learn scholarly professional development skills such as synthesizing related work, identifying research aims, designing ethical studies, collecting data, analyzing results, and presenting results in papers and presentations.</p>

<h2>What will students do?</h2>

<p>REU Participants will:</p>
<ul>
  <li>be trained to become the next generation of scholars to conduct cross-cutting computing research;</li>
  <li>prepare for graduate education and research career opportunities through preparatory workshops and one-on-one mentoring;</li>
  <li>engage in an interactive mentoring relationship with a faculty member and graduate student;</li>
  <li>work with mentors to disseminate research;</li>
  <li>inspire middle school and high school students to consider computing through REU student panels, workshops, and shadowing opportunities during computing-related summer camps.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Logistics</h2>

<p>Our 2018 REU dates are Friday, May 18 through Friday, July 27, 2018. For the 10 weeks of participation, each student will receive a $5000 stipend, free room and board, and GRE preparation (if wanted).</p>

<h2>How to Apply</h2>

<p>We encourage undergraduate students interested in computing/informatics oriented areas – independent of experience or years in their respective programs – to apply to our REU program.</p>
<p>One of the goals of the REU program is to broaden participation of students from traditionally underrepresented groups in computing and/or who do not have access to research facilities at their home institution. We strongly invite applications from women, students of color, first-generation college students, gender and sexual minorities, veterans, and students with disabilities. Previous research experience is not a requirement.</p>
<p>In preparation for applying to the ProHealth REU Site, please make sure you have:</p>

<ul>
<li>Name and contact information of 2 people willing to write a letter of recommendation for you</li>
<li>We will only contact letter writers of applicants who make it to our video interview round.</li>
<li>Your unofficial transcript (please put your unofficial transcript in a web repository, such as Google Drive or Dropbox (Dropbox Directions: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/help/167" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.dropbox.com/help/167</a>)), and share it only with a person who has a link</li>
<li>A personal statement that discusses your research interests and motivation for being part of ProHealth’s inclusive, collaborative research experience</li>
<li>(Optional) A link to your to a website that shows examples of your project work</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the requirements above, the application will collect:</p>
<ul>
<li>demographic information,</li>
<li>interests,</li>
<li>information about prior experiences.</li>
</ul>
<p>This program is funded in part by the National Science Foundation (NSF). Stipends from NSF funds are restricted to U.S. citizens or permanent residents. International applicants with a stipend through their home institution are welcome to apply. If international applications are selected, we will provide research housing. Other NSF-supported REU programs may be found at the NSF <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/reu_search.jsp." target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/reu_search.jsp. </a></p>
<p><strong>ProHealth reserves the right to review, interview, and select participants on a rolling basis, thus people who apply sooner have a better opportunity for a position within the ProHealth Research community.</strong></p>
<p>Indiana University values diversity and invites applicants from underrepresented groups who will enrich the research, teaching, and service missions of the university. We are an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action employer, and we encourage applications from women, minorities, protected veterans, and individuals with disabilities.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>


<h4>Can I participate in the ProHealth REU Site if I graduate in December 2017 or May 2018?</h4>
<blockquote><p>No, you cannot participate in the ProHealth REU Site if you already graduated. You can only participate in the ProHealth REU site if you graduate after the REU site completes (e.g., it is okay if you graduate in December 2018).</p></blockquote>
<h4>I do not finish school until the end of May/mid-June. Can I start the ProHealth REU site late?</h4>
<blockquote><p>Unfortunately, we cannot have people start late. We start off the ProHealth REU with an intense week to learn all the skills necessary for the REU site and then we utilize a specific mentoring cohort model that does not work well if everyone does not start and finish at the same time.</p></blockquote>
<h4>I recently graduated high school and start college at a univeristy in August/September 2018. Can I participate in the ProHealth REU site?</h4>
<blockquote><p>Students who apply to the ProHealth REU site must already be enrolled in a university. So if you are officially enrolled in a university – either through courses you took at a university during high school or enrolled at your future university early (before May 18, 2018) – you can apply to the ProHealth REU site.</p></blockquote>
<h4>I am not a computer scientist or informatics student, but I am interested in seeing if graduate studies in computing or informatics is right for me. Would the ProHealth REU be appropriate for me based on my skill set?</h4>
<blockquote><p>The ProHealth REU site can be an appropriate place to learn about informatics, computing, health informatics, and research. Please look at the blogs of previous REU students <a href="http://wii.sice.indiana.edu/samanthasblog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Samantha Whitman </a>and <a href="http://wii.sice.indiana.edu/oliviasblog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Olivia K. Richards</a> to investigate their experiences being non-informatics majors in the ProHealth REU site.</p></blockquote>
<h4>I am an international or undocumented student, can I apply?</h4>
<blockquote><p>For undocumented and International applicants, if they have a stipend through their home institution, they are welcome to apply. If undocumented or international applications are selected, we will provide research housing.​</p>

<li>Week 1: Ramp-up week &#8211; we have a ramp up week to teach you skills you will use throughout the REU and learn about each project. We do not assign you a project before the REU, instead during ramp-up week, you learn about each project, practice skills each project requires, and get a better sense of if you want to do that type of research for 9 more weeks. At the end of Week 1, you select your top 3 projects and the faculty look at how you did on project-related assignments to pair you for an optimal research experience.</li>
<li>Week 2-10: Research weeks &#8211;
<ul>
<li>you meet often with your graduate mentor (depending on the project and timeframe, sometimes daily and at least once a week);</li>
<li>you meet at least once a week with your faculty mentor;</li>
<li>you attend weekly workshops to learn more about preparing for graduate studies, research, and graduate careers in and outside of academia</li>
<li>you attend twice a month teas to informally network with faculty, staff, and fellow researchers</li>
<li>you conduct cutting edge research and have a dedicated research space with fellow REUs close to faculty and graduate student mentors</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Week 10: Wrap-up week &#8211; you wrap up your research, make future plans for publication, and present your research at our Summer Research Symposium.</li>
