The Proactive Health Informatics REU aims to build usable and intelligent pervasive systems that empower people to manage their health and see how their everyday decisions impact their progress to achieve future health goals. Our REU site will provide students with a unique opportunity to learn techniques in the areas of human computer interaction, pervasive computing (mobile or wearable), machine learning, privacy, and the social, environmental, and legal implications of these technologies. Students will learn appropriate methods, software tools, and analysis techniques related to their project, thus experience in these areas is not necessarily required. In addition, all students will learn scholarly professional development skills, such as synthesizing related work, identifying research aims, designing ethical studies, collecting data, analyzing results, and presenting results in papers and presentations.
