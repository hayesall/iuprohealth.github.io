The Proactive Health Informatics group regularly hosts K-12 groups to learn more about how technology can improve health. In addition, we organize workshops to teach children how to make circuits, program, and create interactive systems. We are currently organizing an <a href="https://www.sice.indiana.edu/student-life/summer-camp/">e-textile summer camp with Girl Scouts</a>.

We thank <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/">Sparkfun</a> for their support of some of our outreach programs.
